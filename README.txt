This is a python scripted configuration of a double star topology with two switches, 4 hosts linked
 per switch, and a controller linked to the switches with default configuration. I've also included a script compiled by miniedit for a visual 
representation of the configuration i've done.
I used the pingall function along with listing out the IP and interfaces of all the switches and hosts to verify connectivity on the network.
